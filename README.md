# Build and Run
- Step 1: Run the Server from `Server/src/main/java/com/example/demo/Main.java`
- Step 2: Run the Client from `Client/src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloApplication.java`

If the port was busy, change `SERVER_PORT` in client and server then try again.

You can also play the serverless version of this game in branch [withoutServer.](https://github.com/AdvancedProgrammingSUT2022/project-group-03/tree/withoutServer)
